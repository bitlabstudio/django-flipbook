Usage
-----

Basically, there is a Flipbook and its (html) pages. You can edit them inline.

Make sure to install django-summernote, which provides the great summernote
WYSIWYG editor.
Django-App: https://github.com/lqez/django-summernote
Editor: http://hackerwins.github.io/summernote/

All flipbooks are viewed in a general list view. You can also gather flipbooks
in different categories and view them in seperated lists.

You will definitely want to overwrite the templates and add your favourite
flipbook jquery plugin, so I only added simple templates and an example plugin.
Get the plugin here:

Thx to Tympanus so far.

Please take a look at the models.py to check the models for their fields.
There are a lot of possibilities to improve your templates. If you need any
other fields or functions feel free to send a pull request =)
